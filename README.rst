Python Tips
===========

These tips are for beginner to intermediate Pythonistas who have a bit of experience with the language. I focused on general Python tips that I think are good to know.

Please clone or fork, the notebooks are meant to be interacted with. The TOC do not work on GitHib.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the page notebooks won't load on GitHub view them here:
 - `Python Tips <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gpetepg/python_tips/blob/master/python_tips.ipynb/>`_.
 - `Built-In-Libraries <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gpetepg/python_tips/blob/master/built_in_library_tips.ipynb/>`_.

Note that these were written in Python 3 (3.6)

These files are .ipynb. It is a notebook document used by Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment designed to help scientists work with the Python language (as well as many others e.g. R, Julia, Ruby, JavaScript).

I suggest downloading `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Jupyter Notebook is included in Anaconda.

I've included an inline `python tutor <http://www.pythontutor.com/>`_. Just uncomment it and run the cell to use.

Please feel free to contribute, critique and comment.
